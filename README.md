Terraform script for provisioning EC2 instance with graphical Xubuntu environment + Firefox, useful for *very* private browsing, totally not at work.

Run `terraform apply`, then connect with X2Go client (user `ubuntu`) using IP printed back at the end.

There is also manual bash script for Digital Ocean cloud.
